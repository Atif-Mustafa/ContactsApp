3.Optimization(Lazy Loading)



stateful vs stateless component

stateful

stateless - independent component, it's responsibility is only to show the props , it doesn't have any state hooks as well as it is not connected to any store,
also called dumb component, doesn't perform any logic


Lazy Loading
*It is related with router.

*all jsx, css, jpg, png , etc files are bundled together using a bundler called webpack to be deployed 

*webpack minified the files and bundles the files


in lazy loading importing of files will be different
like const file_name = React.lazy(()=> import("./file_name));


<React.Suspense fallback={}></React.Suspense> is used in lazy loading in the app.jsx file / at the top of the component

fallback is loader
